# Description
This folder contains my thesis memory of an illuminated road emergency panel, which can be controlled by a touchscreen and wirelessly. It also contains all the code in an appendices folder. An abstract of the memory is the following:

This document describes the process of improving a road emergency panel which was
developed previously in the electronic technology department in the university of
Valladolid. This project arises from the limitations of the previous panel with the
objective of generate clearly message to the road users.
The main characteristics of the project are taken from a market study from which the
selected components will be selected to meet certain objectives of this project.
In this project a microcontroller will be programmed so it can control the emergency
panel according to a user interface on a touch screen. Additionally, an Android
application will be developed to control the device remotely using Bluetooth. All these
systems will be protected by some 3D printed designs.
