# Description
This project consists of a large custom-made L-shaped desk that will fit into a corner of my living room. The design is made of chipboard and melamine boards, joined together with some 3D printed parts. The L-shape is reinforced by two 20x20mm square galvanised steel profiles, which were cut and soldered to form 2 legs of the structure, leaving a free space under the desk.
