# Description
This folder contains the design of an automatic feeder that uses a DC motor with a gearbox and a homemade encoder to control the amount of food that the device dispenses. The device can be programmed with different numbers of doses and different amounts of food per dose using an interface consisting of two different buttons to navigate between menus on an LCD display. Using a potentiometer, you can select an integer value for the hour and minute of the day to display the food, amount of food and some.

In this case, the manufacture of the MDF pannels were made using a homemade CNC machine, so there is a folder with the GRBL code to use in this machine.

# TODO
Add some photos of the real device.
