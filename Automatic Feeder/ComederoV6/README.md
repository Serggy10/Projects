#Description
This is the 6th version of an automatic feeder that uses an ESP32S3 to control a servo motor to dispense some cat food. The amount of food dispensed is measured by a load cell. This device is configurable from a web page generated by its own WiFi, where you can set the time, the number of doses and the amount of food per dose. You can also connect it to the internet and control it with Alexa. The device is powered by a 12V power supply.
These are some photos of the mechanism and 3D design.

For its construction, it uses some MDF and methacrylate boards and some 3D printed parts, all assembled with M3 screws.
