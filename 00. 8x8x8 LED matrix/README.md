# Description
This was my first huge project with Arduino. It was based on the design of Harry Lee (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5Aq7cRc-mU&ab_channel=HARRYLE). I made some changes to adapt the project to my needs and resources. For example I made a homemade PCB board using a doble layer perfboard to wire all the electronics.

Also I made a 3D design of an enclousure to protect the LEDs and make the device more portable.

After 3D printing and wiring all the LEDs and matrix here is the final product:
