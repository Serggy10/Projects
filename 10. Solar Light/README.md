# Description IC
This project was born out of the poor quality of solar lights on the market. It uses a lithium-ion battery and a DW01A IC to manage the charge and discharge. The charging is done by a solar cell through a CN3163 IC. A video of it working can be found in the Resources folder. Work in progress.
